# NEAR_AI_library
An community-based library of AI models: HuggingFace on-chain

# Overivew
Simple AI Model Registry - Where people can register and discover AI models with metadata. Think of it as a library catalog system, but for AI models.

# Notes
This is primarily a place for me to learn about NEAR's CLI tools, testnet, ecosystem and how to build smart contracts.
